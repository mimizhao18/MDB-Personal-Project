// Time spent away never counts as focus time. How long you were away decides the consequence:
//   5 s to 30 s    track limits warning   a warning when you come back
//   30 s to 3 min  yellow flag            a stronger warning when you come back
//   3 min or more  crash                  the race ends with a DNF
// Pausing first excuses a break of up to 5 minutes. After that, time away counts as a distraction again.
// Two or more warnings (track limits warnings and yellow flags together) also cut the XP and credits you earn:
// 10% off for two, another 10% for each further one, never more than 50%.
